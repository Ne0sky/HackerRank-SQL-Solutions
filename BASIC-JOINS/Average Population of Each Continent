So, I have to find the average population of a continent, which is equal to avg of all the cities population
of a particular continent

avg continent = avg (cities of continent)

select country.continent, floor(avg(city.population))
from city inner join country on city.countrycode = country.code
group by country.continent

we are grouping the data by continent name.
we are then finding the avg of cities on city.code = country.code
we are rounding down to floor value
